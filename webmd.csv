25-34,Female, Additional Medications to Treat Depression ,5.0,5,5,5,"I started taking Abilify 2mg by itself. I had really rough side effects the first week including: nausea, heart burn, belching, and really high fever. Although the side effects were bothersome after a week they went away, I took pepto for the nausea and heartburn and took Tylenol for the fevers because I was really hopeful Abilify would work for me. If you get these side effects donât stop taking Abilify because it could be so worth it. It is also important to keep increasing the doses at least every week because Abilify does stop working which happened to me. Iâm now taking 5mg and I feel loads better than taking the 2mg. I am able to wake up in the morning feeling motivated and ready to take on the day. Iâm not so agitated or get upset easily anymore. I am able to be happy without it being forced like putting on a mask everyday. Iâm really happy I gave Abilify a chance itâs working really well for me. Read More Read Less  ",abilify,64439

13-18,Female, Additional Medications to Treat Depression ,1.3,1,2,1,"Hi I am Anna and the reason Iâm reviewing this medication is because it changed my life completely (and not in a good way).   Let me start off from the beginning: I was diagnosed with major depression and bipolar disorder when I was around 7 (I am now 15). In my opinion I believe this was an extremely poor diagnosis by my therapist. Anyways, roughly a few months after seeing a psychiatrist I was put on Abilify. I was originally a very healthy and underweight/average kid, but as I continued to take Abilify my weight drastically increased. I was extremely athletic but I still gained weight. As can be expected, as I gained weight, my self confidence dropped as well. My self confidence and mental health was at an all time low from 6th grade to the beginning/middle of 8th grade. In addition I had unhealthy cholesterol levels. My highest weight was around 165 lbs and 5â2. Suicidal thoughts and attempts were a constant in my life because I hated my body and myself so much. Eventually after multiple failed attempts, in 8th grade I was taken off of Abilify. I became homeschooled to help with stress. Even though i was homeschooled and not exercising, I began to lose weight without any major changes to my eating habits. I liked the weight loss and began to âdietâ and dropped A LOT of weight and becoming 3â taller. After people always commenting on my low weight I began to binge and purge (not sure of whether to gain or lose weight) throughout summer and the beginning of 9th grade. I was confused about whether i would gain weight if I ate unhealthy or too much. I was afraid of going back to my âfatâ self but I also didnât wanna get called âa twigâ. I was pulled back and forth. As of today, I am fairly content with my weight and I am aware that Abilify slowed down my metabolism TREMENDOUSLY.  Of course Abilify did not single handedly lead to suicidal thoughts but I think itâs important to understand just how badly the weight gain effected me. Hope this helped :)Read More Read Less  ",abilify,64439

Years after getting off medication, I am still so severely disabled, both physically and mentally, by so many new illnesses I never had before taking medication.  I took this medication for a neurological disorder, but Abilify has plunged me into the dark world of mental illness by causing illnesses including Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and OCD.  Very quickly into taking the drug, I remember asking my mother how a drug with this disabling of side effects was even legal, and it is so disturbing to think that this drug is regularly given to children.  After about two months, I had already developed such severe withdrawals when lowering the dose that I could not get off the drug.  Abilify was so intolerable that it took multiple drugs to counteract its side effects, and even then, they still were nowhere near manageable.  My experience has convinced me that it is a myth that this medication is any safer than older drugs for Tourettes like Haldol and Orap.  While still on Abilify, the drug forced me to say good things about it, thus I suffered in silence.  Once getting off the drug I could finally begin to think clearly enough to tell my real experience.

Once I went off it, I noticed the flood of thoughts racing back into my head, but I decided that Abilify's side effects were worse than the problems I have off of the medication, such as the racing of thoughts in my head and my irritability.   With side effects, I felt way to energized (although that's not the right word to describe the feeling I had), and I think it was akathasia I had, but I'm not sure. It's a hard feeling to describe. I'd go to restaurants and places and some people would stare at me, like ""What the heck?"" and I'd feel bad about it. I went to a crowded beauty salon and some people were staring at me on this medication, like there was something wrong with me.   I wish I could tolerate this drug as well as many people do, because it really helped me mentally, and I felt better mentally, but I decided that the side effects weren't worth it.

At this point I am trying to see what I can do to obtain life insurance, long term care, and disability insurance.  I am working with my psychiatrist and hoping I can get the nutrition approved.  I am working out 4-6 times a week and changing my diet (I wrestled in college so I feel for those with no work out experience).  Work on 5 year baseline then see what you can do to reduce or find alternative that works for you.  Maybe 3 year baseline with no issues is enough.  Read More Read Less  ",abilify,64439

We decided that I would begin by cutting the 2mg pills in half. After a week my skin began to turn red all over my upper body. The itching was uncontrollable. When my skin began to peel I called my primary, who told me to stop the medication and head for the Emergency Department. I have been in the hospital for nearly two weeks now. Abilify has a propensity to cause SJS. The pain and concomitant itching are almost unbearable, and so I was receiving intravenous morphine, 4mg every two hours, plus steroids. The steroids sent my BP up to 205/100 and my sugar to 393, so I get lots of injections to keep these conditions at bay, esp. hydralazine to drop the BP FAST. Now my skin has finished peeling, except for the soles of my feet. SJS has aspects that are similar to those of a first or second-degree sunburn. It is awful.

The depression lifted, as well as the anxiety. The only problems I have with Abilify are that they cause tremors, especially in my left hand.  I have gained weight over the past few years and though I'm not sure if it was caused by Abilify (since it's been in random spurts), I have been unable to lose the weight, which my doctor thinks is because of this medication. I was also put on Ritalin for ADHD symptoms that Abilify has caused. I don't appreciate the inability to lose weight, or the tremors, or the concentration issues, but hey--I guess it's better than feeling depressed, angry, and suicidal.

He has been seeing a doctor and has been on zoloft with little help.  He is a great kid and well liked, but no one was aware of his struggles. At home, there were angry outbursts that included hitting and kicking holes in walls and doors, throwing things.  I was afraid he might hurt himself or someone else, and was afraid to leave him alone.  His doctor switched him from the zoloft to lexapro and 2mg of abilify.  I read through many reviews and was just plain terrified to put him on something like this, but I was also terrified to not put him on it, either.  He is just about 18 and was afraid if he hurt someone, he could get into a great deal of trouble.  He started taking it just this week, and it helped almost immediately.   No outbursts, even when somethings are happening that in the past I would think would spark an issue, and he has been generally in a pleasant mood.  I am so thankful!   Unfortunately, one huge negative is the high price point.  Our doctor provided us with a coupon for a free 30 days supply, and after that a discount of 150 for a 30 day supply, but that will still be tough to absorb.

45-54,Female, Bipolar Disorder in Remission ,4.7,4,5,5,"Abilify has been part of my medication regime for more then 5 years, and for 20+ years of being over medicated I realized it's a hit or miss game, not necessarily the fault of the psychiatric med provider because their guess is as good as mine. Treatment should be a collaboration and we have the power to make a choice. Back to Abilify; in my experience it has been effective in stabilization, but massive weight gain and difficulty in losing weight has been a big problem in addition to sleeplessness. It is my opinion that it has more anti-depressant qualities, so what time of the day you take it and the milligrams you are on is important. Try tweaking the dosage and timing before you write any medication off, including Abilify. I met with a provider that did a second evaluation of my meds after 20 years of being treated at an unrelated facility. He immediately cut 8 different medications with multiple dosages of each per day down to 3 medications only one of each per day. Abilify is still part of my regime, but taking it at night caused me many sleepless nights and nightly anxiety attacks. I am now taking it during the day and it is sure to work as a great accelerant with balanced moods. Again, you must be AWARE and CAREFUL! YOU are the one ingesting this medication, not your provider! When I see my med provider again, I am going to discuss the reduction in the milligrams of Abilify I take as Abilify packs a big punch. COLLABORATION and PARTICIPATION PEOPLE! I can't stress this enough. I also recommend taking meditation classes or anything that works for you to help calm you and ease your perspective of yourself and life. YOU must take action in ASSISTING your medication therapy. A pill can not heal what ails the spirit. Warmth and Loving-kindness to you all. I hope this helps.   Read More Read Less  ",abilify,64439

My hands are a little shaky any way but it made them more shaky and it was bad enough that I couldn't transfer one thing from one pot to another pot with any liquid when I was cooking. Or even pouring something from one cup to another cup it was that bad. I couldn't sweat in the summer I could never cool down and could never get cool. That is one of its major side effects is you can not sweat. And when I got off this medicine and I started sweating again it felt so weird and being able to cool down for after 5 years it was nice. And I got migraines a lot on this medicine too. Because I couldn't get cooled down from the heat and sweat it out and I would suffer and the higher the dose you are on the worse you will not be able to sweat.

After having a son, moving 6x in 4 years (husband in army) I felt myself getting overwhelmed with PPD and Anxiety. The Anxiety was so bad I was not eating, not sleeping and would only stay at home. Abilify was great at 1mg/day. When my doctor felt like I was not making enough progress she upped my dosage. This equated to 35 pounds in 5 months. I was 5""2, 120 pounds. I literally ballooned up so big (mostly in my face and lower abdomen) so quick that most of my friends, relatives even my husband(!) thought I was pregnant again. As a previous sufferer of anorexia and bulemia I began to panic. My anxiety increased so much because of my weight it is hard to describe. For example: if my kids left food on their plates I HAD to eat it. I was obsessed with eating. Additionally, all I did was drink AND RETAIN water. If my husband expressed his concerns I would fly into a rage and eat more. It got to the point where my normal activities (cleaning, laundry, long distance running-my hobby) were near impossible. I began gaining fat that was hanging over my knees, making it difficult to maneuver. Finally I saw my regular (non-pysc) doctor. I saw her after running five miles, THEN DRINKING ONE BOTTLE OF WATER. My face was so swollen that my neck barely fit into my shirt. My doctor did research and blood work and immediately advised me to discontinue use of the Abilify. In three weeks since not taking Abilify I lost 8 pounds. In 4 weeks 12 pounds. I can now run again.

Prior to the Abilify, I was in such a deep depression I did not cook, clean or even shower daily. I was angry most of the time. Stayed in my house unless I HAD to go out. Major anxiety, panic attacks were a routine part of my life. My psyche doctor suggested Abilify a year ago, but I was so afraid of all the potential side effects, I delayed trying it. Finally decided something HAD to change in my life. Started it about 4 weeks ago. The 4th day after I started it, I woke up and actually was excited about living again. Had energy, motivation, wanted to go out of the house and became interested in life again.  Now the downside. Am taking only 2mg and am restless, feel like I am manic, am not sleeping more than 4 hrs a night (broken into 2 2hr intervals)Starting to feel like a walking zombie. Difficulty doing simple tasks like balancing my checkbook. I have a position which requires critical thinking and I feel afraid that I won't be able to think clearly and make the right decision. Worst is the sleeplessness. When I started abilify, I was told to take it a night. I did and woke up with no depression, but felt like I was ""electrified"". Paced, went from one task to the other without really accomplishing anything because my mind was racing. Switched it to taking in the morning to help with the insomnia and saw no difference in the restlessness, talking too much, etc.  Love the overall effect it has on my depression and mood, but after 4 weeks of little to no sleep I am considering going off of it. Paging the MD in the a.m. to see what he recommends. Also noticed extreme thirst and dry mouth and frequent urination. Am asking for bloodwork to r/o diabetes.Read More Read Less  ",abilify,64439
55-64,Female, Other ,5.0,5,5,5,"Have been suffering from major depression, PTSD and anxiety for 8 years. Have been on everything, nothing was working. I was on Cymbalta and Lexapro the longest(years),then with Abilify for a 6 month time period. Abilify (10mg) DID increase anxiety for me, but no weight gain.  Side effects were slight tremors and dark urine. Instead of going back to the doctor, I stopped taking it. Then in 2010, I stopped taking everything, but 1mg of Xanax at night. All the side effects went away. About 2 weeks ago, in desperation of not living life anymore, I found my remaining pills and started taking one a day (10mg). After 4 days, it was amazing. I was actually getting a few normal things done again. The tremors are back though, a little more than the last time I took it, so today I only took .5mg and have had very little shaking, but still feel good. No weight gain, yet. Matter of fact, I am losing a little, (no exercise). However, I go to my doctor next Wednesday, so will find out if taking this is ok with nothing but a Xanax at night, which by the way helps with sleeping. I read a review that someone was taking 15mg! That is WAY TOO HIGH!. PLEASE DO NOT AKE THIS WITHOUT YOURR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL FIRST. DON'T DO WHAT I DID. I ALSO TAKE A COUPLE OF TRAMADOL FOR SEVERE ARTRITIS PAIN AS NEEDED AND I HAVE NO IDEA IF TAKING THESE TWO TOGETHER IS HARMFUL. I WILL FIND OUT THOUGH.  I am praying that I can continue this in a small dosage. This has felt so good for a change. If I can continue,and no other side effects develop or the tremors do not get worse, I will feel blessed to actually be a part of life again, not just an onlooker!

Seroquel worked VERY well for me, but if situational stress increased, I couldn't increase Seroquel due to mental acuity affects at a higher dose.  My doc thought Abilify might be helpful, instead.  Day 1 - nothing.  Felt like I was back to where I was.  Day 2 - agitated, very hungry, and felt a rage that was barely controlled (rage is very unlike me).  Day 3 - feeling almost like the ""I hate Mondays"" gal who shot up a school yard.  I realized, with the help of my wife and a friend that this was NOT okay, even in a transient sense.  Quit taking it and it took 3 days to return to some semblance of normalcy.  Back on Seroquel.  Abilify is WORSE than nothing.  In fact, I consider it poison.

Each 150 mg of Wellbutrin increase the effect of abilify ~50%.  You do the math.  I should sue this Doc for gross negligence and possibly damaging my liver.  DO NOT TAKE ABILIFY AND WELLBUTRIN! Of course I tapered the Wellbutrin to 0 mg and quit the abilify.  The 3/4"" deep pitting from Edema in my lower legs attributed to venous insufficiency went entirely away when I quit Abilify.  The anxiousness and restlessness and sleeplessness went entirely away when I quit Abilify.  I now treat my serious bipolar I with dialetical behavior therapy and CBT.  These seem to be for the past four months far more effective than the medications.  The medications are a bandaid.  The DBT and CBT are ways you get guided teaching to act and not react and accept who you are for what you are.  Moreover you learn you have choices and you can with the help of a therapist that is well trained in DBT and CBT to survive happily and not kill yourself wit these dangerous drugs.  BTW.  Abilify resulted in a 80lb weight gain in 5 years or so, I became prediabetic, and could not sleep.  When I quit I lost 48 lbs in 5 months.  I only have 32 lbs to go!!! I sleep like a baby now.

Re-started at 1/2 mg, and slowly increased to 2 mg. This was in adjunct to Cymbalta 60 mg x 2.  This allowed me to return to work.  The side affects of increasing blood sugar and triglycerides were also immediate, and so difficult to control, and so affected my physical health, that it affected my work performance and had to go on disability.  Even after stopping Abilify, the physical affects appear permanent and very difficult to treat.  At the same time, while I was on Abilify, I had not found a drug that was so effective at controlling symptoms of panic, anxiety, clearer thinking, self-worth and the knowledge I still have something to contribute to life.  Since being off Abilify, I have not been able to hold down a full or part time job.    It is obvious to me that there is some kind of neurotransmitter dysfunction, but even the pharmacological industry does not understand the mechanism of interaction on the neurotransmitters or why it does have an positive affect, or the negative effect on the endocrine system so many users have experienced.  An interesting drug, wished it could have worked for me, instead of being more disabled both emotionally and physically.  Research into why brain injuries, even concussions can cause metabolic syndrome, the same way mood stabilizer drugs affects metabolism.

After time, even the 2.5mg made me edgy if I took it daily.  Another doc added Zoloft 50mg and it seemed to help.  I had insurance for a while from my job, but ended up losing it once again, so I tried to get OFF the Abilify, and ended up in the hospital, after being on it for over a year.  If taken alone, I had to take it at maximum every other day, then add Cymbalta, and I had to take it EVERY day with that to counter the effects of the Cymbalta.  It's just been a screwed up ride.  All told, I was on the Abilify for almost 4 years.  Once again without insurance, I can't afford it, can't take it more than 1-2x a week or I get edgy and nasty, so doc has switched me off of it.

This drug, while helping reduce anxiety, has increased my energy level to the point where I've doubled my workout (intense bicycle exercise, 30 miles every other day) and have a lot of spare energy.      Caffeine doesn't seem to affect me, but I have almost too much energy. I sleep less, work more, do more physical work. I eat more, up to 3k calories a day (I monitor myself) and still lost weight and size.     I feel like I'm jumping over things, looking at things symbolically at times. Example: where things I type make sense even though mispelled. I've never been diagnosed with any of the reasons this drug is prescribed for; this is a test by my doctor and it seems to work out.     But instead of nervous energy it seems as though my physical energy levels have increased ten-fold.     I do not take any other drugs nor drink alcohol at all and am very active physically. My blood pressure at a rest after walking is 130/70's, heart rate is higher than normal while at rest but during workouts is average (70% of 220-my age).

This medication caused me much extreme high anxiety both times. Already having some issues of social anxiety, inherited tremor, and some tremor possibly induced by years of medicinal treatment for differing aspects of manic-depression, I really was at a severe disadvantage by taking Abilify. For me a vicious cycle results between tremor and anxiety especially when taking Abilify. I was taking after breakfast 20mg per day this last time then stepped down to 15mg with no let up in either tremor or anxiety. Having been completely off of Abilify now for 15 days hasn't caused me any negative side effects or concerns of psychosis or mood swings.

I was on it for about a month or two when I began having a bad side effect.  I find it a little funny, but I started to develop facial twitches.  My upper lip would pull the ""Elvis Face"" without me wanting it to and my smile would twitch on the sides as well as having other random facial twitches.  This sort of scared me out of it and I did not refill the prescription.  I'd take it again, if not for the facial twitches.

Yes it has a better side effect profile than Haldol. If your doctor suggests an antipsychotic for you, maybe you should ask him why he thinks you need an antipsychotic. Short term therapy maybe 2-3 days of Zyprexa are enough to take care of crisis situations. Taking this drug routinely is like taking chemo to prevent cancer. Don't think of this as a mood stabilizer.

I don't remember the dosage. I was also takibng Lithium and Lamictal as the time. It worked well for a while but then I felt emotional numb and had cognitive clouding. I was going through a horrific custody battle for my son and was earning more time with him and I figured this was how things were going to be. I was communicating to my psychiatrist and psychologist that I was having a hard time talking to people and remembering things but my psychiatrist didn't recommend a change for almost a year which of course I was scared to do because I was gaining more time with my son. My psychologist never told me she though my meds were off she just said she thought we could move to meeting once a month as I didn't have much to say! Luckily I told a guy I was dating that I was BP and he did research on Abilify and said it was a nasty drug and that I needed to get off of it. I talked to my psychologist again and she said I think you are having cognitive clouding and that you need to talk to your psychiatrist and have your meds changed. I got off it and I'm a new person. I have emotions and can talk to people again. I've since switched counselors and she said I was probably on too high of a dose and that it's not a bad drug, but for me it robbed a year of my life. Hopefully this will help someone else and you won't have to lose so much time in your life.Read More Read Less  ",abilify,64439

My doctor let me try this because the Risperdal I was taking had caused a lot of weight gain, and Abilify is known to cause somewhat less weight gain.  I took it for several months.  It was a terrible experience.  I had one of its most common side effects, which was anxiety and insomnia.  I had constant anxiety just gushing inside my body, and I would be awake all night, over and over again.  I started making fewer and fewer meals and just ate handfuls of peanuts instead just to stay alive because I felt too bad to cook a balanced meal.  I did lose some weight, but the situation got worse, where at 15 mg. I was starting to hear voices again, and I was afraid to ask my doctor to increase the dose because the awful anxiety might have gotten worse.  I finally switched back to Risperdal and later Invega (a slightly improved version of Risperdal), and it was the biggest relief I have ever had in my lifetime.  My sleep immediately went back to normal, no more voices, and the awful gushing anxiety just stopped.  I wish it was easier to lose weight on Invega, but I have had some success in doing so, since it's not like it causes me hunger all the time.  The weight just sort of creeps up on me with these drugs, and it's possible to eat healthy and keep a healthy weight, it just takes some effort.Read More Read Less  ",abilify,64439

45-54,Female, Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder ,2.3,1,5,1,"I was put on Abilify to treat Bipolar Disorder. The Doctor I was seeing at the time kept me on it for 3 years because he could not accept the fact that the muscle movement problems I was having, and still have, could be Tardive Dyskinesia caused by the Abilify. He claimed my symptoms did not match the ""criteria"" for TD, but according to the drug manufacturer & the FDA it DOES. He also claimed that because the possibility of Abilify causing TD was so low there was no way I could have TD!  I fired the Doctor, found one who knows what he's doing & got off Abilify. Now, 3 1/2 years later I STILL have Tardive Dyskinesia & it affects me daily. I'm glad it seems to help some people, but PLEASE BE CAREFUL!  When I was on Abilify I had MANY other side-effects (panic attacks, agoraphobia, problems maintaining my body temperature, skin infections, hair loss, forgetting how to do things, OCD/hoarding, and more, even an autoimmune disorder that has since gone away), thankfully most of those have gone away completely (except the weight gain, skin infections, & while the hoarding tendency is better, it's still there), or at least have become tolerable, but the continuing muscle problems are very frustrating & debilitating to say the least! On a GOOD day I might be able to walk 2 blocks without trouble, on a bad day 10 feet can be a huge struggle.  Abilify also caused my personality to change & I'm still trying to learn how to overcome that (I had a friend who won't speak to me now because of it).  Now that I've been off Abilify I've realized that it was magnifying my moodswings.  I am now on a totally natural/vitamin-based treatment program & I'm doing MUCH BETTER than I ever did on antipsychotics!  PLEASE, if you notice ANY muscle problems, or ANYTHING else UNUSUAL FOR YOU, NO MATTER HOW SMALL, talk to your Doctor immediately!

I began having tremors in my hands which got so bad people were constantly asking why I was shaking so badly. I knew it was caused by the Abilify and took myself off of it by lowering dosage gradually, with my Drs. approval. I've been off this med for about six months and the tremors have not improved and have been told this may be permanent. I regret ever taking this med. I found out that my niece had been taking it for 2 years and developed terrible Parkinson's effects and is now on a Parkinson med she will have to be on for the rest of her life. She is only 31 yrs. old. Her Dr. told her the same ingredients are in it that were used in high concentrations by the Nazi's to torture Jews in concentration camps. I can relate, as it can be somewhat torturous to go through what we both are now.

My work performance has improved remarkably, which is good, because I was slowly digging a hole for myself there.  While I have a way to go there, I'm actually catching up, rather than falling farther behind.  But here is the kicker: For many years, I've suffered from Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS).  My RLS got considerably worse when I went on anti-depressants.  I've been taking Mirapex, which helps some, but it just makes it milder, it doesn't get rid of it.

Pain was quite bad at one point, but the benefits of clear thinking far outweighed that pain.Read More Read Less  ",abilify,64439

35-44,Male, Other ,4.0,4,5,3,"As a physician I feel that this med is potentially a very good medication. Based upon my specialty, I do not prescribe it, but I will say that it is important for patients to be aware that Abilify was grouped with many other atypical anti-psychotics and given a black box warning about potentially common and significant side efects (Especially severe elavations od blood glucose/potential development of type 2 Diabetes, rapid weight gain, and a host of undesirable side-effects).    However, recent clinical research indicates that this drug may be far safer than the others it has been ""grouped with"" (i.e. Zyprexa, Geodon ; And by no means am I stating that the benefits of the above mentioned drugs do not significantly outway the risks).    Abilify is different, apparently acting primarily not only within the dopaminergic system, but specifically within the ""D2 ans D3"" sunsystems, exhibiting both inhibitory as well as stimulatory effects.    Because I have always believed that many depressive disorders can be linked to the dopaminergic system, yet we keep hammering away at the Seretonergic and Norandronergic neurotransmitter systems, this drug may not only proove helpful to some, but more significantly may lead towards far more future research into the dopaminergic system and perhaps breakthroughs in the treatment of depressive disorders.Read More Read Less  ",abilify,64439

Shortly after starting, I noticed he developed a vocal tic (throat clearing).  He has since developed other motor tics.  Rather than change his medication, his doctor has prescribed quanfacine (a blood pressure med for the  most part) to help with the tics.  So far, no luck.  I am without doubt that the Abilify has caused the tics and my fear is that they will become permanent.  My college-age daughter took a small dose to supplement Wellbutrin and was  pleased with the results generally.  However, it caused her to hyper-focus.  It does this as well to my son.Read More Read Less  ",abilify,64439

I was managing my BP1 with cognitive behavioral tools and xanax for episodic agitation, because I didn't want to be on any kind of daily head meds, but after a manic epidsode that went on for days and days and crashed into full blown psychosis, I crawled back to my Doc horrified and willing to do whatever it took to never ever feel that way again. All around, Abilify has made me feel GENTLE. There is no other way to describe it. I feel easy-going, compassionate, hopeful... but also utterly undriven. My house has gone to hell, and I'm just not bothered. I have a disabling writers block (this is how I make my living, peeps), and I just feel like, oh well... it'll clear up. I have no sense of urgency.  I'm kind and loving and patient with everyone in my life, but I can't deal with the constant physical pain and the total lack of give-a-sh*t. When I have stopped taking it for a few days to ""just see,"" the physical pain resolves, and I'm able to feel angry again, but I feel like the crazy rages are out there waiting for me. My blood sugar is through the roof, so I can't see worth a damn and I'm peeing all the time. I love feeling so fearless and gentle, but I don't think I can stay on this wonder drug.

35-44,Female, Bipolar Disorder in Remission ,4.3,4,5,4,My son was first diagnosed with ADHD. His reactions to other medications led us to try Abilify and to question ADHD as his sole diagnosis. This medicine has been a god send for my son who is 8 years old. 2.5 mg a day of Abilify is all the medication he takes. It has made him more able to interact with other children and form and maintain friendships. He is much less reactive and irritable and is happy at school and doesn't complain about it anymore. The only down side so far is some weight gain. We have to work extra hard to get in plenty of physical activity and make healthy food choices to offset the effects of the medicine. Not the end of the world and so far managable. Things are not perfect but I would say they are 80% better for him on this medication and we are thankful everyday. Read More Read Less  ,abilify,64439

This led to instability in work and living space, as well as relationships and health.  I decided to go back on meds, and take 1500 depakote ER at night for racing thoughts and hypomania.  But it made me depressed and I still felt overwhelmed and anxious.    Abilify gave me the worst side effects, but I am thrilled with it.  I take 10mg in the morning.  Nothing has worked as well on my mixed-state depression without making me a total zombie.  All other anti psychotics and anti anxieties I've tried either haven't been helpful enough or have zonked me out so I can't work.  This one made me very sick, I threw up for a few days and got chills and aggitated states.  But after sticking it out, I feel calmer and better and clearer than I have in my whole life.    If you have issues with mixed states, don't write this one off because it sounds scary or the side effects are bad.  I would definitely say its at least worth considering!

He couldnt speak during this but said later that the pain and spasms in his jaw muscles were terrible. He was in extreme physical and emotional distress. When I took him to the E.R. they said he had a dystonic reaction to the abilify, which is in the phenothiazipine family of meds. He was told to never take anything in that family again. After a heavy dose of benadryl in an i.v. He acted like nothing ever happened..Im glad it works so well for some people, but it looks like its back to the drawing board for us. It was such a bad experience that he really doesnt want to take anything at this point. Some people are just very sensitive to certain meds. He had a very strange reation several years ago after starting resperdol where his head turned all the way to the right side and he couldnt move it..same deal, we went to the ER, Got Benadryl, and he was fine...Hopefully one day we can can find something that will work for him without the reaction.

25-34,Female, Other ,5.0,5,5,5,"I have been on Abilify for about 5 months now.  I had my third depressive episode in six years.  I couldn't believe it was happening again.  I have been on Lexapro for those six years.  The first episode I went on Lexapro, the second was because I tried going off of it.  This third time was triggered by a tough break up.  However, I was shocked that I could become that horribly depressed while on medication.  That was the first time I started seeing a psychiatrist.  I can't recommend it more!  I have realized that primary care physicians don't have the knowledge to treat people with more complex situation like me.  My depression was so horrible.  I was on Depakote for a month, which stabilized me, but I gained way too much weight.  Abilify seems like just the right thing for me.  I feel so much better.  My doctor is suspecting that I could have Bipolar II now based on what I went through.  I am weaning off the Lexapro and only take 5mg.  I take only 2mg of Abilify at night.  That is amazing to me that someone soooo depressed could be okay on just a little medication.  That is why it has been so vital to for me to meet with the psychiatrist.  My PC physician just had me on such a high dosage of the Lex and I had insomnia for two years and times of horrible anxiety and panic attacks which I didn't know what cased by that dosage of Lexapro.  I wanted to write something positive about the mental health field and the drugs that we take on here.  I think sometimes these boards draw in people that just want to complain and tell horror stories.  Yes sometimes there are horror stories but don't give up.  Drugs really work.  If I just took a hand full of vitamins and exercised more I would probably be dead now.  Keep at it!  I know trying different things is frustrating, but you can't stop fighting for yourself.  I am a mental health victory.  If Abilify stops working like Lexapro, then I will start fighting to find something again.    Read More Read Less  ",abilify,64439

(Yes, I know this is off-label and it's dangerous to give psych meds to kids, but they are under top-notch medical supervision and I thought it worth the risk; read on to know why.)  It has made a huge difference in their lives.    Before the meds, one son was full of rage and constantly hurting others.  The other had no idea where his body was and once tried to jump out a second story window without even knowing it.  They were stimming all the time.  We tried other treatments like sensory diets and social stories, but it was too difficult to keep up with the needs of both of them plus my other two children who have multiple food allergies.  Our home was a living hell and I was totally exhausted.    Since they've been on the meds, they've been calm long enough to start learning how to deal with their Asperger's and they've made lots of progress.  The older child has learned social skills and now has a circle of friends.  The younger child has moved from violent rage to merely saying he hates us, and is learning how to recognize when he's getting mad and withdraw to his room.    The only thing I don't like about giving Abilify to my boys is that I have to cut the pills in halves and quarters to get the right dose for them.  It would be really nice if they came in juvenile-size doses.  But that's a petty complaint; I'm just grateful the drug is available in the first place.

I was diagnosed as bipolar I in November 08 at the age of 48.  After taking pretty much everything except lithium, I was FAIRLY stable taking 125mg lamictal and .50mg clonazepam with 5mg ambien to sleep.  However, I kept getting more and more hypomanic, with hypersexual tendencies.  My psych added 2.5mg abilify yesterday when I told her I was getting no better, only worse.  The only thing I have noticed today is some drowsiness.  I am to increase dosage to 5mg in 4 days.  If it has adverse side effects I will drop back down to 2.5mg.  After so many months of feeling totally not normal, it is very very refreshing to feel pretty much like I used to feel before the bp diagnosis.  I have gained weight before starting the abilify, about 15 lbs., but I needed it.  I could not eat or sleep for so many months when taking all the other meds that I looked horrible.  I do not need to gain anymore, however, so I am going to do my best to keep the eating under control.  My hope, and my docs, is if the abilify works, to get rid of the lamictal totally and only use the clonopin as needed.  That would be SO wonderful.  Taking all these different drugs when you are already ""messed up in the head"" is a nightmare.

Currently on 5 mg, thinking about going up to 10 or 20 mg.  I'll start with the cons first: Iâve gained about 40-50 pounds eating the same amount of food I've been eating for years, I sleep for 10-14 hours a night, it hasn't stopped my depression, I'm less talkative to my significant other, I'm more stir-crazy than normal (I have jittery legs, feel some tension in my calves and shin), I lose my balance once in a while, my memory seems to be effected (more short term), I get hot much easier than normal (notwithstanding I live in AZ), I get little joy our of sex and masturbation, it's difficult to become happy, and I'm more apathetic than I was when I was manic and unmedicated.  The pros are as follow: manic episodes are much rarer, I'm able to control my emotions (when I have them) more than I could, and I've not cut myself for the time I've been taking this medication.  Honestly, there are a lot of cons to this medication, at least in my experience, even though I'm thinking about going to a higher dose because it seems like I'm building up a tolerance.  I still have outbursts at work and home, albeit much lessened (like I'll get pissed off at an incompetent client and will start swearing like a sailor once they're off the phone).  I still get overwhelmed by life, though not as much as before, though I find it hard to become motivated as well.  I guess I'll move to a higher dose, hopefully I don't keep gaining weight (and yes I go to the gym 3-4 days a week).  I don't think I'd really recommend this medication without trying something else first or without taking something else in conjunction to alleviate these negative side effects.  Granted, I'm just one person, however these side effects are pretty serious to me.  I'm like a slug now, with very little personality.  Moreover, I still have racing thoughts and suicidal impulses.

It helps my moods from cycling as much or as dramatically as they once did.  I have also noticed that Abilify helps rid me of some depressive symptoms.  Most importantly, it helps with some severe anxiety I have, associated with the case of Bipolar I that I have.  Several of my symptoms were gone within two weeks of starting Abilify, which was a pretty dramatic and much needed change!  I may have gained some weight while taking Abilify, but it could also be attributed to lifestyle or other medications.  I also know that my body ""can't handle"" a higher dose than 10 mgs or I get mild tremors.  Overall though, the positive effects definitely outweigh the negative.

Good thing he read the leaflet for Abilify while I was being triaged and pointed out the list of ""rare but dangerous"" side effects that should prompt you to ""seek immediate medical attention"" to avoid ""life threatening and/or permanent injury"". The ER staff had no idea what to do for me, so they started an IV, flushed two bags of saline through me, and ran labs to make sure my liver function was still normal. I was there a total of three hours, and all they said was don't take any more of the Abilify and come back if you get worse. And they reminded me to call my Doctor. It took nearly a week for my body to return to normal, and it was the most painful week I can remember having.Read More Read Less  ",abilify,64439

Abilify has very minimal side effects (unlike most of the other anti-psychotics); however, it didn't completely quell my symptoms - I still experienced some psychotic feelings.  This is not surprising, however, because Abilify is the newest (and ""weakest"") anti-psychotic.  By ""weakest"" I am referring to the fact that it is only a partial dopamine agonist, which, in some cases, facilitates the manifestation of some psychotic symptoms.  However, for many people, Abilify is a highly efficacious drug.  For me, however, it just wasn't quite strong enough, so I switched to Zyprexa (which quells my psychotic symptoms, but has its own related side effects *see my Zyprexa posting*).  In sum, Abilify is a very gentle drug that is well tolerated by many people.  Given the potential side effects of other anti-psychotic drugs, I would try Abilify as my first line of defense.

This was 8 years ago, and I spent the next 6 years self-administering my prescribed cyanocobalamin shots.  However, despite injecting twice as often and 3X the monthly prescription (30 vs 10 units), I never reached the top 20% of the normal blood range.    Curious as to why, and not receiving a viable answer from my Endo or IM doctors, I visited Dr. Google to learn that patients elsewhere in the world (e.g. England, Japan) are being treated now with sublingual doses.  I also learned that the methyl form of B12 does not require an internal conversion to a useable form. So, 16 months back, I STOPPED the injections and daily sublingual doses of Methylcobalamin.  Within 4 months, my blood results were ""off the charts,"" a point approximately 2X the upper normal range, or greater (i.e., <1,999 pci/l).  Since then, under doctor support, my 2-3X per year assessments have been the same except for one coming in about 1,700.    My radical dosage?  I take one 5,000 mg sublingual methylcobalamin per day (though I fully suspect the cyanocobalamin dose would produce a similar result).  My one ""lower"" test result - still more than twice what I received from the shot approach - was obtained after an experimental 4 months taking 1,000 mg sublingual dose (thus, an effective dose level for me).    And yes, I experienced subtle, but NOT scientifically confirmed improvements regarding specific damage neurological system.  Your doctor won't buy in?  Continue the shots AND take the supplements - in moderation, continuing your discussion after your next test results.    Best of luck!Read More Read Less  ",b-12-lozenge,153837

Otherwise Baclofen has been quite the life saver! It gave me the ability to enjoy life easier since I wasn't in so much pain.Read More Read Less  ",baclofen,8615

Side effects not listed: 1) LOSS OF WORDS - I know a word, however, it won't come to me & I have to describe what the word means, before I, or someone else,  comes up w/ the word. 2) UNCONTROLLABLE SPASMS - started w/ my hands, steadily worsened (have dropped many things), has progressed to arms legs & the MOST PAINFUL, my torso & neck. All can sometimes affect a nerve & cause severe radiating pain that may last hours. The ones in my neck invariably trigger a migraine. Since the efficacy of reducing muscle spasms in my spinal regions is nowhere near that of Soma, and causes so many other spasms, I have no other choice than to titer off Baclofen & TRY yet another medicine. I have continued using Baclofen for so long because I have a history of not reacting normally to many medications & since stopping usually involves withdrawal symptoms, I dread trying new meds, ESPECIALLY when I, & my Doctor, know there is a perfectly legal & efficacious med (SOMA), that lawmakers have used their power to INTIMIDATE my Doctor ( an anesthesiologist MD who specializes in pain management), to the point that prescribing certain meds may put his license & medical practice in jeopardy.

I'm on several other medications for hypertension, fibromyalgia, cardiac stents (Plavix)so I don't know if the reaction to Baclofen was caused by a combination of drugs or if it was solely a reaction to Baclofen itself.

Miracle drug, Started me on 3x10mg daily; was too much. Got down to 1-10mg at nite only and extra when needed. Has worked wonders for 10 yrs. Was told no pain associated with MS by several neurologists. Was dismissed by every neurologist after MS not found thru tests, even at MAYO CLINIC in MN. So frustrating, PTL for my Internal Med Doc who wanted to help and did some research. Have also been on Oxycodone for 5 yrs (2 x 5mg daily and as needed) for pain but am not increasing Baclofen and getting off Oxycodone because any pain med with narcotic is getting harder to get script for. DEA is now requiring Doc to pass licensing or tests before they can prescribe narcotic pain meds (at least in GA & FL) so many docs just will not issue scripts for these meds any more. Plus, I have found moving and having to get new docs makes it even harder to get pain meds and we are treated like drug addicts. Pharms have taken the older cheaper good non-narcotic pain meds off the market and replaced with new ones with no generics and very expensive! Pharms are no longer in business to help us, they are only there to make money. Anyway, I agree with so many reviews that Baclofen is a miracle drug and cheap!

35-44,Male, Other ,5.0,5,5,5,"I have extremely severe Irritable Bowel Syndrome, to the point of needing a Fentanyl patch, Hydrocodone, and a neurostimulator to function barely normally.    I was given a Baclofen rx a few weeks ago during an ER visit for muscle spasms caused by the neurostimulator and have found that the Baclofen has cut my use of Hydrocodone in half without any problems with withdrawal.    I have some problems with sleepiness, and notice that others have reported hallucinatory visual or auditory effects. I've studied neuropsychology (phd) and think this may been related to the sleep effect. Lack of sleep can cause hallucinations by essentially causing a person to enter a dreaming-type state while still awake. This happens to me at around 50 hours of being awake.    I've noticed that with less than 7-9 hours of sleep, I will slip into that sleep/dream state since taking the Baclofen. I just deal with emails sitting down after waking up, but think that the hallucinations that others are reporting could be related to taking the medication and not getting enough sleep, or taking a higher dose.    I would suggest monitoring your mental state when going on this drug, and to be aware of potential effects related to sleep, especially when being active. Hallucinations can be an extremely disturbing side effect, but they are less frightening if you know that it is likely a dream-type situation rather than a serious mental health problem. If you do experience these side effects, try getting more sleep before calling a psychiatrist.    But so far it has been a great pain reliever for me, and should be investigated further for IBS patients, especially those who aren't helped enough by Donnatal or Amitriptylene or other -triptylene drugs. Flexeril and Robaxin have no effect on my IBS pain, only Baclofen seems to help.Read More Read Less  ",baclofen,8615

Back then I was prescribed Baclofen but had major problems with side effects. Used diazepam instead until 2009 when I could no longer function due to the long half life of valium making me continually tired. Went back on Baclofen starting with a low dose. It was ineffective for controlling the spasms. As my doctor increased the dosage reaching 20mg 3x daily. It worked somewhat but gave me insomnia and occasional panic attacks. After reaching 25 mg/3x daily with increasingly worse side effects and less than good spasm control we decided I was better off using diazepam. Exxperimenting a bit on my own while keeping my doctor in the loop I have found that using diazepam (5-10mg) in morn and at night (helps me sleep) and taking 15 mg of baclofen in the afternoon seems to be the happy medium.

WITHOUT Drs. orders; I also used Baclofen to relax my bladder muscles during my times of dealing with passing Kidney Stones!

I have had dizzeness, headaches,nausea and forgetfullness with this medication, also at first it would ""knock me out"" and I would wake up in the middle of the night and try to eat or smoke while still half asleep. (Now I can take it without falling asleep) I feel the medication had me too asleep to know what I am doing. All of that has gotten alot better, I sometimes need phenegran for nausea and still wake up and try to smoke and fall asleep with lit cigarettes but I think it is getting better because I don't do it as much.

Then they finally gave me oral baclofen. It helped nearly immediately, and I was angry that they didn't give it to me sooner. However, starting last year I began to have some short-term memory incidents, awakening in the morning and other times of the day when I've been napping, and at first not knowing all sorts of things, like where I am, what year it is, etc, etc, for a few seconds to a few minutes, until I get all my memory back. Then the other night, however, for the first time, I apparently had a severe short-term memory loss while I was apparently awake beforehand, the first time that this ever happened to me, I believe. I then, on a hunch/suspicion researched baclofen online and found out it apparently can cause short term memory problems when mixed with some other meds. Therefore I am interested in knowing if anyone else has gone through this.    I'm therefore going to slowly wean myself off of the baclofen for awhile to see if this is what is causing it, before I tell the doctor and make a big fuss, seeing how much I hate to go to the doctors and so forth, etc. If I still have these memory episiodes after being off of the baclofen, short-term memory-loss episodes which I've had regularly now since Jan '08, 10 months after starting on the baclofen, then I will have to tell the doctor.

Then when I started with my current primary care doctor and we discussed the fact I was tired almost all the time I discovered that valium has a very long half life.I could probably have stopped taking it that day and had a blood level months later.

This medication was prescribed for muscle spasms due to this procedure and the following lengthy and painful rehabilitation of the shoulder joint. After the procedure, narcotic pain medication was restricted due to an addiction to these medications. Firstly, the Baclofen eliminated the muscle spasms and allowed me to sleep with a substantial anti-inflammatory effect on the healing joint. Secondly I found that, strangely, my usual addictive behaviour when exposed to the narcotic pain meds disappeared. I used them as directed, for pain not recreation as I unfortunately usually would, leaving myself short and in pain. I found the Baclofen accomplished these remedies without presenting an abuse potential of it's own. I will ask my doctor about continued therapy to address my addictive tendencies. Cheers.

Over the next two months it began to rise until it was at 155/100 and my doctor took me off Balziva because she was worried the high dose of estrogen was going to cause a stroke.

I did the quick start method (where you start on any given day.), this was decided by the doctor seeing as how I'd never in my life had a period, I couldn't wait around for a Sunday start. I was told to take 2 weeks of pills before engaging in any unprotected excursions because we had no idea where in my cycle my body was. I've been taking it for 4 months now. After 4 months I can say that my body has adjusted pretty well to these meds. The first 3 months I suffered with very tender breasts, headaches, breakthrough bleeding, bloating, and nausea, but month 4 has been a breeze. Give your body time to adjust to the meds, especially if birth control is new to you, eventually all of the side effects will go away, just wait it out! It has worked wonders for me! I actually have a cycle now and they're extremely regular. It only takes 2 placebo pills for me to start and lasts about 5 days. I've been told over time it will lessen and may even actually skip a few. So, word of advice, give Balziva at least 4 months before you decide to try something different.

I was put on it because in addition to I need for contraceptive my menstrual cycles were very painful. That is the only thing I can say it does. From the day I started this pill I was experiencing the extreme nausea.I dealt with it for a few weeks but I became fed up with the constant discomfort and inability to eat so I stopped it until my next period started. I began taking it again with my new cycle and was happy to no longer experience nausea (I find taking it in the middle of eating lunch helps) but about a week and a half into the new pack I started to have irregular bleeding which I have never experienced in my life. So I went to the dr and was told it's normal and is only a problem if it continues past 3 months.

I used to be on .25 mcg of estrogen before Loestrin and that seemed to work well.  I'm now on Balziva and it's .35 mcg of estrogen, which I hope is not too high for me. I will see.  The reason I'm posting is because so many people have put negative reviews about Balziva as a generic brand for Ovcon or FemCon. I justed wanted to make everyone aware that it's required by LAW that generics have the EXACT same ingredients as brand names. So, there should be no difference in the pills, only a difference in the weight of your pocket. The reason generics can be cheaper is because they had no research overhead and everything that the brand name/original producers did.

Before I took Tri Sprintec, I had been taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo and didn't realize there was a problem with my moods, but now that I have the perspective from being on Balziva, I think all the tri-phasic pills cause me to feel like I want to cry all the time, whereas the mono-phasic pills such as Balziva and Femcon make me less upset. Actually, with Balziva, I feel completely level-headed and rarely feel like crying. I don't even have PMS now. Tri Sprintec gave me the heaviest periods I've ever had (Super flow tampons for five days, but without BCPs I rarely have a period and when it comes it's like spotting and nothing more), but with Balziva I wear Regular tampons for four days, and sometimes I can go for several hours without a tampon during my period.

45-54,Female, Seizures with Breaks in Consciousness & Other Symptoms ,5.0,5,5,5,"I have taken most of the epileptic medications available since my first convulsion in 1974. With each medication, I either suffered reactions or my system built a resistance to the action of the medicine.   When I began Banzal I feared my seizures were about to return to a non controlled status. At that time I was on Keppra and Lamictal, with my physician removing me from Lamicatal due to reactions. Within 6 weeks of beginning the rufinimide experimental treatment, my seizures had lessened a significant amount - from several a week to one or two a month. Currently, it has been 18 months since my last seizure. I have been able to complete my Bachelor of Social Work degree and will have my MA in Gerontology in May. Prior to this, my seizures have caused me to be forced to discontinue my education since 1979, each time I attempted to advance.   I believe that further studies are warranted to determine the effect of rufinimide upon the elderly and on women in perimenopause and who are fully menopausal, to see if horomonal changes affect the medication on the system.

In early 2015 her Drs at PMH Perth WA, decided that due to such a poor quality of life raised liver enzymes and bilirubin 200 and shocking pruritis they would try Basiliximab.  This had never been administered at the hospital before to a child, so a protocol was written.  My daughter had the infusion day 1 and day 5 with no notable side effects. She was commenced on Valgancyclovir and Bactrim for her protection (her liver is CMV +ve) About 5 weeks later her enzymes started a downward shift, as did her bilirubin.  This plateaued and so she received another one off infusion 1 month later.  This didn't appear to have much effect until 4 months later.  My daughters bilirubin is 23, her enzymes have fallen to almost normal except for her GGT which is still high, her Pruritis has improved and the last 2 days she has not been itchy at all (she was started on Colesevelam 6 weeks ago), she is sleeping at night, and able to go to school full time.  This has to be the Basiliximab working, we were thinking it was the Colesevelam making the difference, but lowering bilirubin and liver enzymes is not part of its actions from what i have read.  So it must be the Basiliximab working.  She is currently on the transplant list for a  new Liver, but as she is at the moment she has improved so much I doubt she would meet the criteria.Read More Read Less  ",basiliximab-solution-reconstituted-recon-soln,7978
